# Welcome

This is a portfolio I created after taking an introductory Web Development course.
This site was created with HTML and CSS but includes some simple JavaScript exercises from an Intro to JavaScript course located inside the 'JavaScript Portfolio' tab (shown in screenshot below).

# Side note: 
The styling for this portfolio was created in 2019 but I have made plans to revamp it. COMING SOON :)

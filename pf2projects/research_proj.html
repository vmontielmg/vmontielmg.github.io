        <h2>PURPOSE</h2>
      <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vue.js" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, Vue.js is an open-source JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and applications. It was created by former Google employee, Evan You. While working at Google, You had worked with another popular JavaScript framework called AngularJS which is what inspired him to create Vue. He liked Angular but wanted to create a framework of his own with the features he liked about Angular but a much lighter version of it and simpler in design. </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of Vue.js and other JavaScript frameworks is to improve code by making it more efficient while writing less code. Compared to other popular frameworks such as the previously mentioned AngularJS, React.js, Node.js, etc., Vue.js is similar in what it can do but what sets it apart from the others is the simplicity of it. Due to its syntax being very similar to Javascript, learning Vue is possible with the basic knowledge of plain old vanilla JavaScript. This is essential for learning a framework because the learning curve for Vue is much easier compared to Angular and other frameworks. </p>
        
     <p>Some features about Vue.js that are enticing for its customers are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Vue.js allows its users to write their code in HTML or JavaScript files. Helps other JavaScript framework users understand.</li>

            <li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: (previously mentioned) Its syntax is very similar to vanilla JavaScript which makes it easier to learn for programmers with different experience levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Small size</strong>: to download Vue.js, it takes no time to download it due to its small 18-21kb size compared to Angular.js(143kb), React.js(up to 43kb), and others. Based on a 2017 <a href="https://medium.com/unicorn-supplies/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-a-2017-comparison-c5c52d620176" target="_blank">article</a>.</li>

        <h2>LEARN</h2>
        <p>
            The actual <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/" target="_blank">Vue.js </a>website is also very helpful. It includes many code snippets to show examples which I personally find the most helpful. The website shows the code for the HTML and JavaScript files to show how Vue is used in those files and it shows how similar the syntax is between Vue and JavaScript. This is very essential to learning a new or first-time JavaScript framework because the syntax is familiar. This website effectively shows how to create a Vue instance, which is needed to create a Vue application. There are also great examples of event handling and modifiers, components which are Vue instances, and more.
        <p> 
            <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vuejs/vuejs_introduction.htm" target="_blank">Tutorialspoint</a> is a really helpful website that has helped me through many questions I have had in the past about anything and everything programming. I have used their tutorials for different topics like C++, Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and now Vue.js. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the Vue.js tutorial, you can learn how to download and include the script tag directly in your HTML file to include Vue into your projects. This website has about the same as the actual vuejs.org website does but what I like about tutorialspoint is that it shows programs using what you are learning. There is even a section for <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/vuejs/vuejs_examples.htm" target="_blank">examples</a> which is really useful to see how the code works. Since I have used tutorialspoint in the past, I feel more comfortable using this website for tutorials because it includes great examples and the format of the tutorials is clear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Websites like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vuejs.org</a> and <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/" target="_blank">tutorialspoint.com</a> are great examples of free resources that can help any web developer/designer learn about vue.js and more. As well as other online resources available on the internet, there are also Youtube video lectures on Vue.js and how to use it. With all the free resources we have today, learning new technologies and topics is at our fingertips and can expand our knowledge which in turn can open up possibilities for us.

            <h2>COMMUNITY</h2>
        <p>
            Another amazing detail about Vue is the community behind it. <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/join.html" target="_blank">Vue Community</a> is accessible through their own website which has links to different ways to connect to people. They have a forum where you can ask questions and looks at questions other people have had. They also have a <a href="https://chat.vuejs.org/">Discord</a> chat so you can chat with the community at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another cool feature they have is a <a href="https://github.com/vuejs" target="_blank">GitHub</a> where you can report bugs or request a feature which is really unique and strengthens that community feel.

            <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
        <p>
            I found two cool websites off of <a href="https://vuejsprojects.com/tag/websites" target="_blank">vuejsprojects.com</a>.
            The first one I liked was a guessing game <a href="https://javascript-game.firebaseapp.com/#/" target="_blank">here</a> and it is a guessing game about JavaScript libraries.
            The second site is <a href="https://element.eleme.io/#/en-US" target="_blank">Element</a> which has event listeners and component demos.
            Using a framework such as Vue.js is very beneficial in website such as these because if you check the page source, the code is wayyyyy much shorter than what it would have been had it been created in only vanilla JavaScript by itself. It shortens code and it is already well-structured so most of the hard part is done for programmers.

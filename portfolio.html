            <p> This project, I was tasked to make a webpage that would serve as a resume for myself. Since I had no previous experience yet in HTML or CSS, I kept it VERY simple.</p>

                <div class="overlay"><div class="center"> PROJECT 3 </div> </a> </div> </div>
             <p> For this project, I wrote a website about my favorite city I have ever visited. I haven't travelled much but one place I was fortunate to visit was Hale'iwa, HI, OAHU. This was the first time I created a navigation menu, and separated sections using float. </p>

                <div class="overlay"><div class="center"> PROJECT 4 </div> </a> </div> </div>
             <p> I was tasked to create a landing page for a service(tutoring). This gave me practice with forms, but it gave the hardest time when writing the css. </p>

            <h2> Project 5 - Favorite Music Videos </h2>

                        <div class="center"> PROJECT 5 </div> </a> </div> </div>
                  <p> This project's topic was my favorite music videos. I realized I don't really care about videos as much so I had to look for some of my favorite songs' videos. This gave me practice embedding videos, as well as using web fonts from Google, and the CSS media query. </p>

                    <div class="overlay"><div class="center"> PROJECT 6 </div></a> </div> </div>
               <p> I had the chance to choose my topic and a topic suggestion was favorite *blank*, I decided with flowers since it was spring time. The task was to use CSS Transitions in a heading and do image tricks with some photos I chose. This one was really fun and cute. </p>

                        <div class="center"> IMAGES LAB </div> </a> </div> </div>
                    <p> In this lab, I chose my own theme again, I went with sunsets because they are beautiful (mostly because I wanted to use 1 of the 1000s of sunset pictures from my phone). The task was to style 3 images like a polaroid/card, icon sized, and a hero image with text. I love the aestheic that hero images gives a picture/webpage. </p>
